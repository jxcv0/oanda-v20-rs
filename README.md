This is a wrapper around the autogenerated [oanda-v20-openapi](https://crates.io/crates/oanda-v20-openapi) crate that I also maintain.
The idea is that eventually this crate will evolve into a much more ergonomic interface, however for the time being I recommend using the raw generated crate is it much more functional.

A Rust client for the OANDA v20 REST API.

Pull requests are welcome.
